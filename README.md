# SuperStore-Sales-Dashboard

This an interative Superstoresales dashboard created using Microsoft powerBI .The Superstore Sales Dataset is taken from kaggle .
Firstly I have done the ETL process on the data set and also have made use of DAX formula to create calculated measure and columns ,analyzed the relationship between the table and finally developed an interactive dashboard which easy understandable to anyone .
Here there are three donut charts first chart shows that the most of the sales preferred in supermarket is COD and the least is card payment, the second graph shows segment wise sales to consumer segment is most and the least sales is made to Home office segment and the third dpnut chart shows the superstore sales in western region is more than that of southern and eastern which has the least sales.
The report also shows Sales and profit by month and year ,sales by ship mode,Sales by category, Sales and profit by state and sales by sub category.
The above cards which are the KPIs which shows total sales, total orders placed, total profit made and avg ship days . 
The other tab shows the sales forecast for next 15 days based on the current sales pattern of the SuperStore .
